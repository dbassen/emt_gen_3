# Generation 3 of EMT signaling model

1. Model code in src is generated by gradle code generator.
   This is done off server on a personal computer with a working gradle installation.

2. Some files are edited to reflect modeling aspects not captured by the generator [GEN2 INFO]
   A) Control.jl: Integration functions (other than mean) and special logic
   This includes Ecadherin transcription,  TGFb3 transciption, SNAIL_SLUG transcription.
   B) Balances.jl: set ribosome and RNAP rates to 0
   C) Datafile.jl:
      h) Change Network.dat pointer
      i) Set ribosome and RNAP levels as well as PPase levels
      j) Set VEGF parameters (not explicitly known from data)
      k) Set satuation constants for Ecadherin Bcatenin system
      l) bionumbers scaling


3. If species in the model have changed...
   A) Run df_parser.py
      Downstream names.dat is used by _________... (plotting software)
   B) the_edit_editor.py
      remaps indices in the edit files
